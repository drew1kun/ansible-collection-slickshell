This file is needed only on some Linux distros (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04)
The issue:
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/2804

This file is not controlled by this repo and resides here:
ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/spell/en.utf-8.spl

It will be substituted during role run.

Leaving this info here so it is more visible.
Also, do not want to clutter my gruesome role's code with another directory creation task.
Therefore, using this file and it's parent folder only as an info and placeholder.
